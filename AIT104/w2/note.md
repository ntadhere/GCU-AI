## Multiple Linear Regression
- Linearity: linear relation between features and the target
- Equal variance: variance of residuals should be constant across all features 
- Multivariate error distribution: Multivariate-error means vector-of-error
- Independent observations: no autocorrelation
- Lack of Multicollinearity: Features are not correlated with each other
- Outlier: Outliers should not be present too far
