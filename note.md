# Machine Learning
### What is Machine Learning?
- Machine Learning is about finding pattens in data
- It is a collection of algorithms and techniques used to design systems that learn from data
- **Classification**: Is this A or B?
- **Regression**: How much or how many?
- **Clustering**: How is this organized?

#### Classification:
- Classification is identifying to which set of categories a new observation belongs based on the set of training data containing in the observed categories
- Classification problem with two classes is known as a two-class classification problem. Those with more than two classes are known as multi-class classification problems
- Classification predict base on observation:
    - Predicting the winner for the U.S 2020 Presidential Election
    - Predicting if a tumor is cancerous
    - Classifying the different types of flowers

#### Regression:
- Helps in forecasting the future by estimating the relationship between variable
    - Predicting the sales number for a particular item for the next quarter
    - Predicting the temperatures for next week
    - Predicting the lifespan of a particular model of tire


#### Clustering
- Helps in grouping similar data points into intuitive groups. 
- Given a set of data, cluustering helps you discover how they are organized by grouping them inito natural clumps
    - Which viewers like the same genre of movies.
    - Which models of hard drives fail in the same way

#### TYPES OF ML ALGORITHMS:
- Supervised Learning algorithms are trained with **labeled dataset**
    - Labeled dataset means that a group of data has been tagged with a label. Thhis label provides informative meaning to the data
    - House Size >< Price Sold => Price Sold is the label
        - Predicting a price for the house is a **regression problem**

- Unsupervised leaarning algorithms are used on data with no labels, goal is to find relationship in the datat
